# メリクリ2025

NOTE: Aspects of the site are in Japanese, that’s mainly so I can use the words I’ve learned in Japanese and do not forget them

Welcome to my Christmas project, メリクリ! Out of boredom and wanting to do something for the holiday season, I got this idea to make a Christmas-themed website. メリクリ features a blog with a new entry every day, sort of like an Advent calendar/Christmas countdown. Besides the blog, the site also has a ton of other things, such as media recommendations, gift guides, holiday messages, and more. If you want to add something to the site, don’t hesitate to open an issue in this repository. I hope you enjoy my site and have a very Merry Christmas!
